Who dares disturb me while I’m writing my memoirs?!
<<next_frame 1>>
<<char_toggle romeo>>
My name’s Romeo.
I was told I could find a wizard out in these woods.
Are you her?
<<next_frame 1>>
<<char_toggle wizard>>
Yes, of course, it is I. A Wizard, just like it said on the sign. 
<<next_frame 1>>
Now leave me to drink away my wretched sorrows in peace!  
<<char_toggle romeo>>
Do wizards usually drink this much?
<<char_toggle wizard>>
They certainly do once they reach this point in their lives.
<<char_toggle romeo>>
I thought you wizards weren't supposed to age.
<<char_toggle wizard>>

<<next_frame 1>>
Oh for magic's sake, what is it you want from me?
<<char_toggle romeo>>
I was told you could help me find love. I want to feel and experience what True Love is like.
<<next_frame 1>>
<<char_toggle wizard>>
Ha! Don’t we all! Do we get it...? 
Almost never.
<<char_toggle romeo>>
So... is that like a hard no? I walked a long way for this.
<<char_toggle wizard>>
The powers which contained my love parted from me long ago. 
I divided what remained of them into three individual orbs and scattered them across otherworldly realms. 
Until the orbs are back within my grasp, there’s nothing I can do for you.  
<<char_toggle romeo>>
How much farther do I have to walk for those?
<<next_frame 1>>
<<char_toggle wizard>>
Silly being. The orbs are not in this world. You must traverse the OVERWORLD! 
Only I hold the power to send you to where you need to go.
<<char_toggle romeo>>
And you promise to give me True Love if I find them?
<<next_frame 1>>
<<char_toggle wizard>>
Indeed I would. Bring all three orbs to me and your wish will be duly granted.
<<next_frame 1>>
<<char_toggle romeo>>
Then retrieve your orbs I shall! Where do I start?
<<next_frame 1>>
<<char_toggle wizard>>
Ha Ha Ha.
