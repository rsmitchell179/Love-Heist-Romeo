<<set_speaker budalia>> 
Greetings, fellow Reject Citizen!
Can I interest you in a spray can for some colorful graffitiing?
<<set_speaker romeo>>
Graffitiing? What's that? Sounds complicated.
<<set_speaker budalia>>
Oh dear, no, no, no. Graffiti is simply an expressive form of art! It involves a little can containing paint in spray form, which can be applied to create all sorts of unique designs. The evidence is seen all around us.
<<set_speaker romeo>>
Well, now that sounds super fun! Even maybe too much fun for me!
Also, I think you have me confused with someone else. My name's not Reject Citizen. It's just Romeo.
<<set_speaker budalia>>
Ahh, so you are definitely not from around here!
We call all those who reside here in Reject City Reject Citizens. It's very unifying for the community.
<<set_speaker romeo>>
Reject City? This doesn't sound like a friendly place.
Why would the Wizard want me to go here?
<<set_speaker budalia>>
The Wizard? Sorry, what did you say your name was again?
<<set_speaker romeo>>
Romeo.
<<set_speaker budalia>>
Ah, yes! Romeo. That's it! You're the one I was supposed to meet!
<<set_speaker romeo>>
Cool! Does that mean you have my orb?
<<set_speaker budalia>>
Heavens no. Let me start by introducing myself. My name is Budalia McMailman. I'm the personal courier for the Wizard, sent here to be your means of communication with her.
<<set_speaker romeo>>
Then itâ€™s good to meet you here, Budalia!
What exactly is this area?
<<set_speaker budalia>>
It's a skate park.
Don't they have skateboarding where you're from?
<<set_speaker romeo>>
I'm not sure about skateboarding, but people do get on these boards with wheels and do tricks and flips.
<<set_speaker budalia>>
That's precisely what skateboarding is.
<<set_speaker romeo>>
Huh, I see. I thought it was only a Reject Citian thing.
<<set_speaker budalia>>
It's actually become quite universal!
<<set_speaker romeo>>
I'm not sure about universal. Skateboarding in outer space doesn't sound safe.
I don't have to do that for the orb, do I? I have no helmet, I could scrape my knees, and the gravity-
<<set_speaker budalia>>
Oh, certainly not. In fact, I have something here for you that can point you in the right direction. It's a personal letter from her majesty, the Wizard. It reveals the location of the orb.
<<set_speaker romeo>>
Now that's cooler than graffitiing and skateboarding combined!
She really is one kind Wizard for wanting to help me find my True Love!
<<set_speaker budalia>>
Yes, kindness is truly where her heart is at...
<<set_speaker romeo>>
It sure seems that way to me!
<<set_speaker budalia>>
Well, alright. I'll let you be off now, Romeo. Go and claim the orb that only comes from a place of kindness and not deceit!
<<set_speaker romeo>>
I will!
